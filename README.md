Discord calendar bot that allows you to register tasks, events, set timers and many more (basically a calendar app, but on Discord). Planning on also making a mobile app that integrates with the bot, from where users can manage their tasks and receive notifications about tasks and events for the day, week, month and year.

How to use the bot:
    - Add it to a server using this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1261051106767671490
    - Execute /commands to see a list of commands that you can use.
    - Enjoy!
